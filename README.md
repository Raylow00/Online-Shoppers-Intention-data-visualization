Data Visualization on Kaggle dataset Online Shoppers Intention

A beginner's data visualization practice using Kaggle dataset on Online Shoppers data. Most people shop online these days, but there are so much data available behind each click, each scroll and of course each transaction that allow us to visualize what's going on with these people who shop online. Mostly, what drives them to shop online? Or when does this usually happen? These are the key insights found through this visualization practice.

What I learnt:
- Basic data visualization techniques such as plotting a pie chart, a strip plot and comparing two features using boxplots and bar charts.
- Basic data preprocessing method such as one-hot encoding and scaling
- Basic model fitting using Random Forest Classifier
